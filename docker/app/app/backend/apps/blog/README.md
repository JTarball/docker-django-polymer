## 'blog' App

A basic 'blog' app perfect for website announcements / basic blog page

- simple & basic
- static page with a list of blog posts
- detail page for each post
- code highlighting via <code></code> blocks powered by pygments


# Currently not implemented
# - search ability via Redis (search app - thus if you have this installed the search app should be installed by default)
